        <p>Legistream is a modern and simple way to watch Australian parliaments live. It was created with the goal of centralising the parliaments to a single area, without the need to use the often outdated and slow parliament websites. Legistream was developed by and is actively maintained by <strong><a target="_blank" class="opengov-hook" href="https://github.com/OpenGovAus">OpenGov Australia</a></strong>, an independent team of developers based in Australia with the common goal of making it easier for the general public to securely access political information relevant to them over the internet.
            <br>Legistream does this by optimising the parliamentary streaming experience, isolating the streams to one parent website, all natively within the userâ€™s browser. It also bypasses the need to use a Flash player on both the Queensland and Northern Territory streams, offering a more secure experience.
            <br><br><strong><a target="_blank" class="opengov-hook" href="https://github.com/OpenGovAus">OpenGov Australia</a></strong> hopes you find the service useful!
