Legistream is the easiest way to stream Australian parliaments live. Legistream bypasses the need to use the often slow and outdated state/territory parliament websites, streamlining the experience. Legistream also bypasses the need to use a Flash player on both the NT and QLD websites, offering a more secure viewing option for people interested in those jurisdictions.

Legistream uses our Python package [legistream-backend](https://github.com/OpenGovAus/legistream-backend) to gather stream URLs and metadata from the parliament sites.

- We also plan to integreate [Aus-Bills](https://github.com/OpenGovAus/Aus-Bills) in some form in the future.
